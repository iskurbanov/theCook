Think of them as a stand-in for the brown sugar you might find in a more traditional stir-fry sauce or Asian marinade. You can substitute half a tablespoon of raisins per date if you’d prefer (golden raisins would work too). Whichever route you choose to take, this dish is a wonderful way to get your family to eat their greens!        ",

It’s autoimmune protocol compliant, meaning it has no dairy or nightshades like a more traditional Greek Salad would, and it’s just drowning in flavor. You won’t miss the feta or tomatoes at all, I promise! This is one of my favorite salads to throw together for a quick lunch, with or without the meat.",
